            <h3>Short Video Game 1 - Blue Fire</h3>

            <p>"Travel through the perished world of Penumbra to explore unique areas filled with diverse enemies, sharp 3D platforming challenges, quests, collectibles, and more." - quoted from the back of the game's package.</p>

            <p>Blue Fire is on the shorter end of video games when it comes the main content. For other consoles, it has a DLC that allows you to make your own voids along with a short area expansion. I liked how it was organized and how explorable the world was while I was playing it.</p>

            <h3>Lore of the Game</h3>
            <p>"In the beginning, there were 6 Gods. Each mastered a unique element and together they created the land of Sarana. To protect the new land, the Gods made a sacred pact known as the Oath of Sarana that would keep peace and balance over the land.</p>
            <p>However, the sixth God possessed more power than the others and over time he was blinded by his strength and eventually turned against his siblings. The sixth's hate towards the others grew so much that it took a life of its own, consuming the God and thus creating the Black Shadow, a currupting energy which destoryed everything in its path, turning the living it claimed into Shadows."</p>
            <p>"A war between the Gods and the Black Shadow broke out and lasted thousands of years. Having lost all hope, the gods united their power and created Penumbra, a floating castle hidden from the Black Shadow, protected by the essence of the Gods, a power called Blue Fire. The Gods sheltered the remaining living creatures in the castle. High above the sky, hidden from the curruption. Penumbra prospered." - Lore curtesy of the little packet included with the game.</p>
