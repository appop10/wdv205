                    <h3>Rich in Polyphenols</h3>
                    <p>Cocoa
                        is rich in polyphenols, which have significant health benefits, including
                        reduced inflammation and improved cholesterol levels. However, processing cocoa
                        into chocolate or other products can substantially decrease the
                        polyphenol content.</p>

                    <h3>May Reduce High Blood Pressure by Improving Nitric Oxide Levels</h3>
                    <p>Studies
                        reveal that cocoa is rich in flavanols, which lower blood pressure by improving
                        nitric oxide levels and blood vessel function. Cocoa containing between
                        30-1,218 mg of flavanols can reduce blood pressure by an average of 2 mmHg.</p>

                    <p>Cocoa
                        can improve blood flow and reduce cholesterol. Eating up to one serving of
                        chocolate per day may reduce your risk of heart attack, heart failure and
                        stroke.</p>

                    <p>Flavanols
                        in cocoa can support neuron production, brain function and improve blood flow
                        and supply to brain tissue. They may have a role in preventing age-related
                        brain degeneration, such as in Alzheimer's disease, but more research is
                        needed.</p>

                    <p>Cocoa
                        may exert some positive effects on mood and symptoms of depression by reducing
                        stress levels and improving calmness, contentment and overall psychological
                        well-being. However, more research is needed.</p>

                    <p>Cocoa
                        and dark chocolate may reduce your risk of diabetes and maintain healthy blood
                        sugar levels. However, there are some conflicting results in the scientific
                        evidence, so more research is needed.</p>

                    <p>Cocoa
                        products are associated with a lower weight, and the addition of cocoa to your
                        diet may help achieve faster weight loss. However, more research is needed on
                        this topic to determine exactly what type and how much cocoa is ideal.</p>

                        flavanols in cocoa have been shown to have promising anti-cancer properties in
                        test-tube and animal studies, but data from human trials is lacking.</p>

                        extract has demonstrated some anti-asthmatic properties in animal studies.
                        However, human trials are needed before it can be recommended as a treatment.</p>

                    <p>Cocoa
                        can promote healthy teeth by fighting bacteria that cause cavities, though this
                        does not apply to sugar-containing products. It also promotes healthy skin by
                        protecting it from sunlight and improving circulation, the skin surface and
                        hydration.</p>

                        0.4 ounces (10 grams) of high-flavanol chocolate in your diet. Adding cocoa can
