            <p>When you think about Alaskan Dog Breeds, does an image of a team of huskies pulling a sled over icy tundra come to mind?  Sled races?  Iditarod?</p>
            <p>Most all dogs that originated or were developed in the cold north can be classified as one type; Spitz Dogs.</p>
            <p>This group is very diverse, but people from ancient times to the present have used Spitz dogs to herd, hunt, pull, or guard. Some of the smaller types were and are still used solely as pets.</p>
            <p>The ancient history of this group of dogs still remains a mystery, but it is thought that most originated in Asia, and may have migrated over the old land bridge during the last ice age.</p>

                    <h3>Alaskan Malamute</h3>

                    <p>The iconic Alaskan Malamute is an ancient basal breed that has roots in the Arctic as far back as 4,500 years ago! These powerful dogs were originally developed in the Norton Sound region of Alaska by the Malemiut Inupiaq people.</p>

                    <p>Alaskan Malamutes are all-star sled and work dogs. They are most comfortable when working as part of a team (or pack) and are highly family-oriented people lovers.</p>

                    <h3>Alaskan Klee Kai</h3>

                    <p>A recent addition to the Alaskan dog breed family, the Alaskan Klee Kai was developed around the 1970s. They were bred to embody the intelligence and arresting look of the Alaskan Malamute, but with the focus on creating a companion breed of significantly smaller stature.</p>

                    <p>The Alaskan Klee Kai comes in three sizes that range from 5 to 22 pounds. These pups are sweet, energetic, and loving family dogs.</p>

                    <h3>Alaskan Husky</h3>

                    <p>The speed demon Alaskan Husky gets the majority of their genetics from Salukis and English Pointers, while the long-distance runners are predominantly Siberian Husky and Alaskan Malamute.</p>

                    <p>And no Alaskan Husky is exactly the same. That's because this breed is not a pure, recognized breed but a "mongrel." The two genetically distinct versions of the Alaskan Husky are those bred for sprinting, and those for long-distance.</p>

                    <h3>Malanees</h3>

                    <p>Our next Alaskan dog breed has a mixed lineage. The massive Great Pyrenees meets the hardworking Alaskan Malamute in this big fluffy hybrid breed. The coat of the Malanees has less body than the Malamute parent, but well suited to cold mountain temperatures. They don't do so well in hotter climates, and daily river trips are advised during summer.</p>

                    <p>Malanees are exceptionally gentle with children, affectionate, and though a little stubborn at times, they enjoy spending time with their family.</p>

                    <h3>Alusky</h3>

                    <p>For the sweetest wolf dog around, look no further than the Alusky. This hybrid breed is a natural mixing of two of the best sled dogs: the Alaskan Malamute and Siberian Husky.</p>

                    <p>The combination of the stamina of the Malamute, the speed of the Husky, and the high work drive of both make for a powerfully athletic work dog. Alusky dogs are known for their howling, mischievous nature, and fondness for people.</p>

                    <h3>Alaskan Malador</h3>

                    <p>This next Alaskan dog breed is a cheerful cousin to the arctic breeds. This is the cross betwee the Alaskan Malamute and Labrador Retriever hybrid, the Alaskan Malador. Their coats are dense and waterproof, but less suited for bitterly cold weather than purebred arctic dogs.</p>

                    <p>Alaskan Maladors are eager to please, active, and exceedingly loyal to their family.</p>

                    <h3>Alaskan Chinook</h3>

                    <p>This hybrid is a winning mix of Alaskan Malamute and the Chinook, a breed originated in New Hampshire. The cold weather hardiness of the Malamute meets the tireless gait and tough, athletic body of the Chinook for a true workhorse of a dog.</p>

                    <p>The Alaskan Chinook is playful, affectionate, and especially devoted to children.</p>
