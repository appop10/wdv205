        <h2>About the Venue</h2>

        <div>
            <h3>
                <p>What is the seating policy?</p>
                <span class="material-symbols-outlined">
                    expand_less
                </span>
            </h3>
            <p>The doors will open 30 minutes prior to show time. We like to begin all concerts on time so please allow plenty of time to unload passengers, park and find your seats before the concert begins. Auditorium doors are closed when the program begins. If you do arrive late, please wait by the entry doors until the piece is finished and then quietly take your seat. If you must leave before the conclusion of a performance, we request that you only do so between program works in order not to disturb other patrons. All concerts are open seating and there are two rows reserved for our season ticket holders.</p>

            <h3>
                <p>What are the house rules?</p>
                <span class="material-symbols-outlined">
                    expand_less
                </span>
            </h3>
            <p>We request that you turn off all cellular phones and pages before entering the concert hall. As the acoustics of a concert hall are designed to carry the human voice, please refrain from talking and whispering as this can be very distracting to performers and concert-goers. Smoking is not permitted inside the building and food/drinks (except water) are not permitted inside the auditorium.</p>

            <h3>
                <p>Are there provisions for wheelchairs?</p>
                <span class="material-symbols-outlined">
                    expand_less
                </span>
            </h3>
            <p>The main entrance has a cement incline located by the main stairs, and the first floor is accessible. As of right now, the second story is only accessible via stairs.</p>

            </h3>
            <p>We encourage concert-goers to feel comfortable when attending a concert. Some people enjoy getting dressed up for a night at the concert hall; on the other hand, there's nothing wrong with jeans. If you dress as if you were going out to dinner, you won't feel out of place.</p>

            <h3>
                <p>How long do concerts run?</p>

                </span>
            </h3>
            <p>The program length varies, but a typical concert lasts approximately 90 minutes, including one intermission. Please feel free to visit our reception where refreshments are provided after the concert!</p>

            <h3>
                <p>Can I buy tickest at the door or do I need to buy them ahead of time? What payment methods do you accept?</p>

                </span>
            </h3>
            <p>Tickets can be purchased prior to the concert by visiting our ticketing page on this Web site. Tickets may also be purchased at the door. Online purchases are handled by Brown Paper Tickets, and you can pay via credit card or PayPal account. At the door, cash, checks, or major credit cards are accepted.</p>
